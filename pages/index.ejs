          <h5>Production Considerations</h5>
          <p>This app is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in
          production without further modifcations. Dependencies on databases, and other
          types of services are purposley not within the scope of this app.
          Some considerations below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>User information is stored in server side sessions. This may not provide
            the best user experience or be the best solution for your usecase, espcially
            if you are adding more functionality.</li>
            <li>The application can handle light usage, but you may experience API rate
            limit issues under heavier usage. Consider storing data locally in a secure database
            or caching requests.</li>
            <li>Specifc pages are only protected by basic auth. To support multiple users 
            (admins, team members, customers, etc) consider implementing a form of ACL.</li>
